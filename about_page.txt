How we Started:
Although David and Da-Me were separated at birth, fate would bring them back together at the
Iron Yard, for no bond was stronger than one forged in the fire of code boot camp.

Through difficult trails they learned the skills necessary to traverse the world unguided.
Before they could begin this quest, they needed supplies, but more importantly
they needed a magical messenger bag that could hold everything that was needed. David, searched
far and wide for the perfect bag but couldn't find a price that was acceptable. They thought, there
must be a better way! Instead of going from store to store looking for the perfect bag at the perfect
price, or standing idly by hoping the price would drop, they decided to make Wishcastr.com.

As they started this journey they knew they couldn't do it alone. So they requested the assistance
of a talented wizard named Lacey. They had heard of her gifts in Angular, HTML and CSS. These were
powerful tools that would help them combat future issues they knew they would come to face.

What Wishcastr.com does:
Now with Lacey joining the group, they were ready. Ready to create a site with a one stop search,
that would crawl through the Amazon, scour through the bay, the Ebay that is, and potentially many other
sites to traverse. Wishcastr.com could search for any magical item and set the price so something more
affordable. Wishcastr.com would then alert them when it had found that item for their threshold price.

What we actually do.
