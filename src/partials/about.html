  <h1>How We Started</h1>
  <p>Although David and Da-Me were separated at birth, fate would bring them back together at the Iron Yard, for no bond was stronger than one forged in the fire of code boot camp. While at the Iron Yard, they discovered a Ruby which they used to preform magical feats. They traveled along Rails with their new found talents and were tested mercilessly by their sensei Fox Matthews.</p>

  <p>Through difficult trails they quickly learned the skills necessary to traverse the world unguided.</p>

  <p>Before they could begin their quest, they needed supplies, but more importantly they needed a magical messenger bag that could hold everything that was needed. David, searched far and wide for the perfect bag but couldn't find a price that was acceptable. They thought, there must be a better way!  Instead of going from store to store looking for the perfect bag at the perfect price, or standing idly by hoping the price would drop, they decided to make Wishcastr.com.</p>

  <p>As they started this journey they knew they couldn't do it alone. So they requested the assistance of a talented wizard named Lacey. They had heard of her gifts in Angular, HTML and CSS. These were powerful tools that would help them combat future issues they knew they would come to face.</p>

  <p>Now with Lacey joining the group, they were ready. Ready to create a magical being named Wishcastr.com that would crawl through the Amazon, scour through the bay, the Ebay that is, and potentially many other treacherous sites. With Wishcastr.com they could search for any magical item and set the price to something they found acceptable. Wishcastr.com would then alert them when it had found that item for their acceptable price.</p>

  <p>Amazed at what they created, they decided to set the powerful being upon the world for all to use. For they knew the struggle of traversing alone and with Wishcastr's help they believed they could help those who have faced similar battles.</p>
